*** DPHY


+ u-boot:
DPHY: Initializing...
DPHY: CLK_MIPI_DSI: PLL_4X=1584000000, PLL_2X=792000000, M=6, actual=132000000 Hz
DPHY: Configuring (priv=4cf80508, 4 lanes, bitrate 399168000)...
DPHY: lanes stored in priv: 4
DPHY: Powering on (priv=4cf80508, 4 lanes)...
DPHY: Timings: hs_prep=25, hs_trail=35, clk_prep=19, clk_zero=131

There is no clock set rates, so has to do it all by it self?


+ linux:

linux driver "allwinner,sun50i-a100-mipi-dphy".

clock source can set rate.

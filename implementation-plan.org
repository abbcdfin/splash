# Implementation Plan - Project Splash

This plan outlines the steps to enable MIPI DSI splash screen support for the Allwinner T113-S platform in U-Boot.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure and Core Drivers

### 1. Analyze and Map T113-S Display Pipeline in U-Boot
- Task: Investigate `drivers/video/sunxi/sunxi_de2.c` and `sunxi_lcd.c`.
- Goal: Determine how to insert `tcon_top`, `dsi`, and `dphy` into the probe sequence.
- Status: DONE. Decided to merge T113/D1 logic into `sunxi_de2.c` using `CONFIG_SUNXI_GEN_NCAT2` guards.

### 2. Implement `sun8i_tcon_top` Driver
- Task: Port minimal TCON_TOP driver.
- Goal: Enable routing from Mixer 0 to TCON LCD 0.
- Status: STARTED. Skeleton created in `sun8i_tcon_top.c`.

### 3. Implement `sun6i_mipi_dsi` Controller Driver
- Task: Port MIPI DSI controller driver.
- Goal: Support DSI host initialization and basic DSI packet transfers.
- Status: STARTED. Skeleton created in `sun6i_mipi_dsi.c`.

## Phase 2: Driver Logic Implementation

### 4. Implement Clock and Reset Initialization
- Task: Implement T113 specific clock setup in `sunxi_de2_composer_init` within `sunxi_de2.c`.
- Goal: Enable DE, TCON, DSI clocks in CCU.
- Status: TODO

### 5. Implement DSI and PHY Logic
- Task: Implement register programming for DSI and D-PHY.
- Goal: Bring up the DSI link.
- Status: TODO

### 6. Port ILI9881C Panel Driver
- Task: Port `drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-ilitek-ili9881c.c` from Linux.
- Goal: Implement the `hd50004c30` initialization sequence.
- Status: TODO

## Phase 3: Integration and Verification

### 7. Splash Screen Enablement and Testing
- Task: Configure U-Boot to use the new display path for the splash screen.
- Status: TODO

* Overview
The goal of Project Splash is to enable a boot-time splash screen for the Allwinner T113-S platform within U-Boot (mainline, targeting v2026.04). This requires back-porting the MIPI DSI display stack from Linux v6.10 to the U-Boot driver model.

* System Context
- **SoC:** Allwinner T113-S
- **Board:** raft-gw-argon-vb
- **DTS:** sun8i-t113s-raft-gw-argon-vb.dts
- **Display Pipe:** DE2.0 (Display Engine) -> TCON_TOP -> DSI Controller -> D-PHY -> LCD Panel
- **Current State:** U-Boot currently supports LCD output via LVDS on this SoC; Linux currently supports LCD output via MIPI DSI; this project pivots that output to MIPI DSI in u-boot.

* design approach
Use agentic AI system to perform the back-porting.

* Technical Source Material

** Linux v6.10 Driver Sources
Linux v6.10 souce code should be copied into the project as linux subdirectory, as we don't need to modify its code.

** U-Boot v2026.04 Target
u-boot mainline (targeting v2026.4 release) is included in this repository as a git submodule u-boot.

* Implementation Constraints
- Use concise, professional C code adhering to U-Boot coding style.
- Transform the implementation from Linux kernel to suit U-Boot's driver framework.

* Success Criteria
- [ ] U-Boot successfully probes the MIPI DSI controller.
- [ ] The LCD panel initializes and shows the static splash image.
- [ ] The display remains stable until the Linux kernel takes over.
